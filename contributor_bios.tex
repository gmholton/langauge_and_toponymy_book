This book would not have been possible without the help of many people along the way. Thanks go especially to the individual chapter authors, both for their contributions and for their patience along the way. Thanks go also to the participants in the 2015 Alaska Native Place Names workshop, where many of these papers were first presented. Thanks also to the Alaska Native Language Center and  Bristol Bay Native Corporation for helping to sponsor that workshop, and further to ANLC for providing publication subventions.  In Hawaii, Katie Gao assisted with the initial layout of the volume; A.L. Blake helped with copyediting; and Brad McDonnell provided the \LaTeX\ template for the volume.  Last but not least, our sincere thanks to Jim for all of his dedication and inspiration.
